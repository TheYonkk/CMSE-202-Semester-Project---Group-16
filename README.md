# Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a model that determines if the current oil pressure in a racing engine is acceptable. By using previously recorded data from the MSU Formula Racing Team, a model will be created using instances of good and poor oil pressure.

Once a model is created, it can be used to analyze data in real-time on the MSU race car. If poor oil-pressure is detected, the driver can be notified in real time - perhaps saving and engine from destruction as a result of oil loss.
